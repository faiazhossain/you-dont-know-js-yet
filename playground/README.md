# Code Playground - Interactive JavaScript Practice

**Purpose**: Learn by doing, not just reading.

---

## How to Use This Playground

### Step 1: Read the Concept
Read the section in the YDKJS book first.

### Step 2: Open the Corresponding File
Each section has a corresponding `.js` file here.

### Step 3: Run and Experiment
```bash
# Using Node.js
node playground/[topic]/[filename].js

# Or use browser console
# Copy paste the code
```

### Step 4: Break It, Fix It, Learn It
- Change values and see what happens
- Intentionally break the code
- Try to predict output before running
- Explain to yourself why it behaves that way

## Types of Exercises

### 1. **Predict the Output** (PREDICT)
Code blocks with questions. Predict before running.

### 2. **Break and Fix** (BUG)
Intentionally broken code. Your job: fix it.

### 3. **Before vs After** (COMPARE)
Two approaches doing the same thing. Which is better? Why?

### 4. **Complete the Code** (TODO)
Fill in the blanks to make it work.

### 5. **Debug Challenge** (DEBUG)
Find and explain what's wrong.

### 6. **Experiment Zone** (PLAY)
Sandbox for your own experiments.

## Best Practices

1. **ALWAYS predict before running**
2. **Read error messages carefully**
3. **Use console.log liberally**
4. **Comment your understanding**
5. **Create variations and test them**

---

## Progress Tracking

After each exercise:
- Mark as done in the file header
- Note your confidence level (1-5)
- Add questions to your section notes

---

## Getting Started

1. Start with: `playground/get-started/values-vars/`
2. One concept at a time
3. Don't move on until you understand WHY

*Remember: The goal is deep understanding, not completion.*
