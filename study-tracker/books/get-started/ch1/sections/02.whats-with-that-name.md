## Key Concepts

### The Name "JavaScript"

- The name "JavaScript" is primarily a marketing artifact, not a technical description.
- It was chosen to appeal to the large community of Java Programmers in the mid 1990s.

- The script part reflected the trend of lightweight programs embedded in web pages.

### History of the Name

- Brendan Eich originally named the language Mocha.
- Internally at Netscape, it was called LiveScript.
- "JavaScript" was selected for its public release as a strategic marketing name.

### Relation to Java

- JavaScript is not related technically or int its design.
- Superficial Syntax similarities are there which both comes from C language.

### Official Name: ECMAScript

- The official, standardized name of the language is ECMAScript, governed by TC39 and ECMA International.

- Since 2016, versions are named by year (e.g., ES2019, ES2020).

- JavaScript (JS) is the implementation of the ECMAScript standard (e.g., in browsers or Node.js).

### Why the Name Confusion Matters

-Misunderstanding the name leads to incorrect assumptions about the language's capabilities, purpose, and ecosystem.

- Clarifying the distinction helps in learning it as its own language, not as a "lite" version of Java.

- Using precise terminology (e.g., JS or ES20xx) avoids perpetuating confusion.

## My Notes

-The name was a business decision, not a technical one. It's important to mentally separate "JavaScript" from "Java."

- JS has evolved far beyond its original role as a simple "scripting" language for web pages. It's now used for full-stack development, mobile apps, servers, and more.

- The trademark situation is interesting but largely irrelevant for developers today.

- The progression from ES5 -> ES6 (ES2015) -> ES2016+ marks the shift to annual, incremental updates.
