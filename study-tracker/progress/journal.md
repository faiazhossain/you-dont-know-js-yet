## Journal Entries

### Entry 1

**Date**:
**Day**: 1
**Book/Chapter**: Preface

**Reflections**:

Starting my YDKJS journey! Key insights from the preface:

- The philosophy: explore ALL parts of JS, not just "good parts"
- Learning approach: Read completely first, then re-read section by section
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks per chapter, 9-12 months total
- Goal: Deep understanding of HOW code works, not just THAT it works

**My Commitment**:

- I will not binge-read
- I will practice every concept
- I will ask "WHY?" for everything
- I will teach what I learn

**Start Date**: 27th jan, 2026
