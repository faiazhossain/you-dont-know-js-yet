- Ask "WHY?" for everything
- Take your time (1-2 weeks per chapter!)
- Connect concepts across chapters
- Build real projects
- Teach what you learn

### DON'T:
- Don't binge-read multiple chapters
- Don't skip exercises
- Don't rush through sections
- Don't just read - practice!
- Don't be afraid to re-read
- Don't move on without understanding

---

## Step 8: Progress Tracking

### Daily Checklist
```bash
# Open your tracker
open study-tracker/progress/tracker.md

# Check off items as you complete them:
- [ ] Section read
- [ ] Notes taken
- [ ] Practice done
- [ ] Confidence rated
```

### Confidence Scale
- **1** = Need complete re-read
- **2** = Understand basics, need practice
- **3** = Comfortable, need more application
- **4** = Strong understanding
- **5** = Could teach this to others

**Goal**: Aim for confidence level 4-5 before moving on!

---

## Step 9: Getting Unstuck

### If a concept is confusing:
1. Re-read the section
2. Code along with all examples
3. Write your own variations
4. Look at MDN documentation
5. Search for additional resources
6. Join study groups or forums
7. Take a break and come back later

### Document what you don't understand:
- Add to `study-tracker/progress/tracker.md` under "Questions & Review Topics"
- Revisit these topics weekly

---

## Step 10: Making the Most of This

### Best Practices
1. **Study consistently** - Even 30 minutes daily is better than binge sessions
2. **Code every day** - Write JavaScript daily, even small snippets
3. **Build projects** - Apply what you learn to real projects
4. **Teach others** - Explaining concepts reveals your understanding
5. **Join a community** - Find others studying JS
6. **Stay curious** - Always ask "WHY?"

### Recommended Daily Schedule
- **30-60 minutes**: Read/study
- **30-60 minutes**: Practice code
- **15 minutes**: Update notes and tracker
- **15 minutes**: Journal reflection

Total: ~1.5-2.5 hours per day

## You're Ready!

### Start Now:
1. Read the preface
2. Read Chapter 1 completely
3. Begin your journey!

### Remember:
> "You could spend a week or two on each chapter, and a month or two on each book, and a year or more on the whole series, and you would still not be squeezing every ounce of YDKJSY out."
> - Kyle Simpson

Take your time. Deep understanding is the goal, not speed.
