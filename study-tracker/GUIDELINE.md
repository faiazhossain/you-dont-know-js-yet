## Confidence Rating (1-5)

After each section, ask yourself:

```
1 = I don't understand, need to re-read
2 = I get the basics, need more practice
3 = I understand it, need to apply it more
4 = I'm confident, can use it independently
5 = I could teach this to someone else
```

**If rating is 1 or 2:**
- Re-read the section
- Write more code examples
- Don't move to next section yet

**If rating is 3, 4, or 5:**
- You can move to next section
- Still review notes later

✓ Write code every day
✓ Ask "why?" for everything
✓ Take your time
✓ Rate your confidence honestly
```

### DON'T
```
✗ Don't skip sections
✗ Don't read multiple chapters at once
