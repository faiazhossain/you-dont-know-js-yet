## Study Philosophy (from Preface)

**Key Principles:**
- Don't binge-read - spread out your learning
- Read each chapter completely first, then re-read section by section
- Practice code between sections
- Spend 1-2 weeks per chapter, 1-2 months per book
- A year or more for the whole series
- Always ask "WHY?" - understand HOW your code works

**Recommended Approach:**
1. First pass: Read entire chapter without stopping
2. Second pass: Re-read section by section
3. Practice each concept with code
4. Apply to real projects
5. Teach/discuss with others

## Important Reminders

From the preface:

> "You could spend a week or two on each chapter, and a month or two on each book, and a year or more on the whole series, and you would still not be squeezing every ounce of YDKJSY out."

> "Don't binge these books; be patient and spread out your reading."

> "Good enough to work is not, and should not be, good enough."

---

## Getting Started

1. Read `ydkjs-books/preface.md` - **Read this first!**
2. Read `CURRICULUM.md` - Your roadmap
3. Start with Book 1, Chapter 1
4. Check `progress/tracker.md` to track your journey

---

## Study Tips

- Always ask "WHY?" - Understand the mechanics
- Code along with examples
- Build small experiments for each concept
- Connect concepts across chapters
- Discuss with others
- Teach what you learn
- Write blog posts or notes
- Revisit chapters after finishing

---

## Author's Philosophy

From the preface:
- Explore **all the parts** of JavaScript
- Don't fear "bad parts" - understand them
- Every part of JS is useful in some context
- Deep understanding > surface knowledge
- You never fully "know" JS - it's a continuous journey

---

Happy studying! Remember: The goal is not to finish, but to deeply understand.

*"You can always know JS better than you currently do."* - Kyle Simpson
