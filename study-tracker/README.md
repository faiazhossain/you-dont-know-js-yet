## Study Philosophy (6-Month Intensive Track)

**Key Principles:**
- Focused, intensive study with daily consistency
- Read each chapter completely first, then re-read section by section
- Practice code between sections (50+ lines daily minimum)
- 7-8 days per chapter, 5-7 weeks per book, 6 months total
- Always ask "WHY?" - understand HOW your code works
- Build projects weekly to solidify learning

**Recommended Approach (6-Month Accelerated):**
1. First pass: Read entire chapter without stopping (Days 1-2)
2. Second pass: Re-read section by section with intensive practice (Days 3-6)
3. Practice each concept with code (20+ examples per concept)
4. Apply to real projects (weekly practice projects)
5. Teach/discuss with others (explain concepts out loud)

## How to Use This Study Environment (6-Month Track)

### 1. Daily Study Routine

For each chapter section (2-3 hours daily):

```bash
# 1. Read the section from the book (30-45 min)
# File location: ydkjs-books/[book-name]/chX.md

# 2. Open the corresponding note template (15-20 min)
# File location: study-tracker/books/[book-name]/chapters/chX/[section].md

# 3. Take notes, write questions, code examples

# 4. Code along with examples (30-45 min)
# Write 20+ examples for each concept

# 5. Practice with exercises (30-45 min)
# File location: study-tracker/books/[book-name]/exercises/chX.md

# 6. Update your progress (5 min)
# File location: study-tracker/progress/tracker.md

# 7. Quick journal reflection (5-10 min)
# File location: study-tracker/progress/journal.md
```

**Minimum Daily Output: 50+ lines of JavaScript code**

### 2. Note-Taking Templates

Each section has a template with:
- **Key Concepts**: Main ideas from the section
- **Code Examples**: Important code snippets
- **Questions**: Things you don't understand

## Important Reminders

From the preface (adapted for 6-month track):

> "You could spend a week or two on each chapter, and a month or two on each book, and a year or more on the whole series, and you would still not be squeezing every ounce of YDKJSY out."

**6-Month Intensive Track Note:**
This curriculum compresses the author's recommended timeline into 6 months. This requires:
- 15-20 hours per week commitment
- Daily consistency (2-3 hours on weekdays, 3-4 hours on weekends)
- Active coding (50+ lines daily minimum)
- Building projects weekly

> "Don't binge these books; be patient and spread out your reading."
> (In 6-month track: focus on depth through practice, not speed reading)

> "Good enough to work is not, and should not be, good enough."

---

## Getting Started

1. Read `ydkjs-books/preface.md` - **Read this first!**
2. Read `CURRICULUM.md` - Your roadmap
3. Start with Book 1, Chapter 1
4. Check `progress/tracker.md` to track your journey

## Author's Philosophy

From the preface:
- Explore **all the parts** of JavaScript
- Don't fear "bad parts" - understand them
- Every part of JS is useful in some context
- Deep understanding > surface knowledge
- You never fully "know" JS - it's a continuous journey

---

**By completing this curriculum, you will:**
- Master all 3 pillars of JavaScript (scope/closure, prototypes, types/coercion)
- Understand `this`, closures, and modules deeply
- Build 20+ practice projects and 5+ capstone projects
- Write 2000+ lines of intentional JavaScript code
- Develop the ability to teach these concepts to others
- Have a portfolio of projects demonstrating deep JS knowledge

---

Happy studying! Remember: The goal is not to finish fast, but to deeply understand.

**This is an intensive track** - if you need more time, take it. Quality of learning always trumps speed.

*"You can always know JS better than you currently do."* - Kyle Simpson
