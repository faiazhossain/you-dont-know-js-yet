# You Don't Know JS Yet - 6-Month Intensive Curriculum

**Duration**: 26 weeks (180 days)
**Goal**: Deep understanding of core JavaScript concepts through focused, intensive study

---

## Study Guidelines (6-Month Accelerated Track)

### Per Chapter Schedule (7-8 days instead of 14)
- **Days 1-2**: Complete read-through (no stopping) + initial notes
- **Days 3-6**: Section-by-section deep dive with hands-on practice
- **Day 7**: Exercises, review, and real-world application
- **Day 8**: Buffer for difficult concepts, projects, or catch-up

### Daily Study Session (2-3 hours minimum)
1. Read/re-read the section (30-45 min)
2. Update notes in chapter template (15-20 min)
3. Code along with examples (30-45 min)
4. Write your own experiments (20-30 min)
5. Complete exercises (30-45 min)
6. Update progress tracker (5 min)
7. Quick journal reflection (5-10 min)

### Accelerated Learning Strategies
- **Focus on depth over breadth**: Master each concept before moving on
- **Active coding**: Write 50+ lines of code daily minimum
- **Teach to learn**: Explain concepts out loud or write brief summaries
- **Weekend deep dives**: Use weekends for larger projects and reviews
- **Morning consistency**: Study at the same time daily for habit formation

## Important Notes

**This is an intensive track requiring:**
- 15-20 hours per week commitment
- Consistent daily practice
- Active coding (not passive reading)
- Regular project building
- Comfort with being challenged

**If you fall behind:**
- Use buffer days strategically
- Focus on understanding over speed
- It's OK to extend to 7-8 months
- Quality > speed always

**Remember:**
> "Good enough to work is not, and should not be, good enough."

> "You can always know JS better than you currently do." - Kyle Simpson
