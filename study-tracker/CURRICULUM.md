## Progress Tracking

Update `progress/tracker.md` after completing each:
- [ ] Section
- [ ] Chapter
- [ ] Book
- [ ] Exercise set
- [ ] Project

Use confidence levels:
- 1 = Need complete re-read
- 2 = Understand basics, need practice
- 3 = Comfortable, need more application
- 4 = Strong understanding
- 5 = Could teach this to others

---

## Notes

- This is a **minimum** curriculum - you may need more time
- Some chapters may require 3 weeks instead of 2
- It's OK to spend extra time on difficult concepts
- Quality of learning > speed of completion
- The journey never ends - JavaScript is vast and deep

---

## Daily Checklist

For each study session:

- [ ] Read section/chapter
- [ ] Update note template
- [ ] Code along with examples
- [ ] Write your own experiments
- [ ] Complete exercises
- [ ] Update progress tracker
- [ ] Journal reflections
- [ ] Identify questions for review

Remember: **"Good enough to work is not, and should not be, good enough."**
